<h1> Welcome! </h1>

<h3>
  HI THERE!
I am Onyekwere Anthony Udochukwu.
</h3>

<h3>
  I love creating solutions to problems. Currently, I create web applications, such as full websites, SPAs, Web-APIs, etc. My favourite tool is Visual Studio, using ASP.NET. I speak a few languages, but I am most fluent in C# 😎.

I also have a passion for mentoring and education, especially for young boys; the boy child does not have a lot of mentorship these days. You can catch me helping young teens to achieve their dreams at NTIC Lagos, where I am also an ICT educator.

I am a Nigerian of Igbo decent, in case, you were wondering; and I want to see my country be the true giant of Africa. I will be sharing the different ideas I have about making this possible, so please stay tuned.
</h3>

<h5> Lets not go into my favourite football team and all that… Its a heart breaking story.😢… </h5>

<b> I HOPE YOU FIND INTERESTING IDEAS IN MY HUB. </b>
